I DON'T USE HOLYC, GITHUB THINKS THAT MY "programa.hc" IS A HOLYC PROGRAM, NO, IT'S MY OWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE called "HC" of "HuguiniCompiler"

FOR MAKING A PROGRAM, YOU HAVE TO CREATE A FILE CALLED "programa.hc" AND THEN ENSURE THAT "compiler.exe" IS ON THE SAME DIRECTORY OF THE PROGRAM

THIS COMPILER TRANSFORM THE HC PROGRAM TO ASSEMBLY, AN THEN IT GENERATES A "build.bat" FILE THAT THEN YOU HAVE TO EXECUTE IT TO COMPILE WITH NASM AND EXECUTE WITH QEMU, THE PROGRAM CANNOT COMPILE IT BY ITSELF BECAUSE DOESN'T COMPILE VERY WELL, BUT THE COMMANDS OF NASM AND QEMU ARE IN "build.bat"
